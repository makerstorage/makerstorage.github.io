  </h1>

	<p>SchoolBus is a platform of easy-to-use electronic building boards that empower you to learn electronics. The SchoolBus Boards snap together with simple connectors, no soldering, no wiring needed.</p>

	<p>If you have an idea and need a quick solution for the proof of concept. Do not waste time to solder components together or design something from scratch. Just use schoolBus boards to see if your idea is working. You can then design your own custom boards starting by the opensource schematics of the schoolBus boards.</p>
